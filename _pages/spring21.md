**Course Description:**

The first wave of data science focused on accuracy and efficiency -- on what we _can_ do with data. The second wave focuses on responsibility -- on what we _should_ and _shouldn't_ do. Irresponsible use of data science can cause harm on an unprecedented scale. Algorithmic changes in search engines can sway elections and incite violence; irreproducible results can influence global economic policy; models based on biased data can legitimize and amplify racist policies in the criminal justice system; algorithmic hiring practices can silently and scalably violate equal opportunity laws, exposing companies to lawsuits and reinforcing the feedback loops that lead to lack of diversity.  Therefore, as we develop and deploy data science methods, we are compelled to think about the effects these methods have on individuals, population groups, and on society at large.

Responsible Data Science is a technical course that tackles the issues of ethics, legal compliance, data quality, algorithmic fairness and diversity, transparency of data and algorithms, privacy, and data protection. The course is developed and taught by [Julia Stoyanovich](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/julia-stoyanovich) (Assistant Professor at the Center for Data Science and at the Tandon School of Engineering, and member of the [NYC Automated Decision Systems Task Force](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/adstaskforce/index.page)) and [George Wood](https://gwood.me) (Moore-Sloan Faculty Fellow at the Center for Data Science).

**Prerequisites:** Introduction to Data Science, Introduction to Computer Science, or similar courses.

**Lab Materials:** Labs will be conducted using [Jupyter Hub](https://dsga-3001009.rcnyu.org/). Students should use their NYU NetID to log in, and click the "Assignments" tab to find the material for each week. After lab, links to the notebook for each class will be included on this page.
